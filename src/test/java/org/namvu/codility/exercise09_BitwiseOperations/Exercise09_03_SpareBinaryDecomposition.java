/**
 * [HARD] SparseBinaryDecomposition: Decompose int into sum of ints having no
 * consecutive 1s in binary form.
 *
 * A non-negative integer N is called sparse if its binary representation does
 * not contain two consecutive bits set to 1. For example, 41 is sparse, because
 * its binary representation is "101001" and it does not contain two consecutive
 * 1s. On the other hand, 26 is not sparse, because its binary representation is
 * "11010" and it contains two consecutive 1s.
 *
 * Two non-negative integers P and Q are called a sparse decomposition of
 * integer N if P and Q are sparse and N = P + Q.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * 8 and 18 are a sparse decomposition of 26 (binary representation of 8 is
 * "1000", binary representation of 18 is "10010"); 9 and 17 are a sparse
 * decomposition of 26 (binary representation of 9 is "1001", binary
 * representation of 17 is "10001"); 2 and 24 are not a sparse decomposition of
 * 26; though 2 + 24 = 26, the binary representation of 24 is "11000", which is
 * not sparse. Write a function:
 *
 * class Solution { public int solution(int N); }
 *
 * that, given a non-negative integer N, returns any integer that is one part of
 * a sparse decomposition of N. The function should return âˆ’1 if there is no
 * sparse decomposition of N.
 *
 * For example, given N = 26 the function may return 8, 9, 17 or 18, as
 * explained in the example above. All other possible results for N = 26 are 5,
 * 10, 16 and 21.
 *
 * Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
 *
 * N is an integer within the range [0..1,000,000,000].
