/**
 * [EASY] StoneWall
 *
 * Cover "Manhattan skyline" using the minimum number of rectangles.
 *
 * You are going to build a stone wall. The wall should be straight and N meters
 * long, and its thickness should be constant; however, it should have different
 * heights in different places. The height of the wall is specified by an array
 * H of N positive integers. H[I] is the height of the wall from I to I+1 meters
 * to the right of its left end. In particular, H[0] is the height of the wall's
 * left end and H[Nâˆ’1] is the height of the wall's right end.
 *
 * The wall should be built of cuboid stone blocks (that is, all sides of such
 * blocks are rectangular). Your task is to compute the minimum number of blocks
 * needed to build the wall.
 *
 * Write a function:
 *
 * class Solution { public int solution(int[] H); }
 *
 * that, given an array H of N positive integers specifying the height of the
 * wall, returns the minimum number of blocks needed to build it.
 *
 * For example, given array H containing N = 9 integers:
 *
 * H[0] = 8 H[1] = 8 H[2] = 5 H[3] = 7 H[4] = 9 H[5] = 8 H[6] = 7 H[7] = 4 H[8]
 * = 8 the function should return 7. The figure shows one possible arrangement
 * of seven blocks.
 *
 *
 *
 * Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
 *
 * N is an integer within the range [1..100,000]; each element of array H is an
 * integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000].
